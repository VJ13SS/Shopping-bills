"""
This Python script manages billing and collections for XYZ Company.
It allows users to generate bills for purchases and retrieve the total collection for the current day.

Constants:
- NAME: The name of the company.
- ADDRESS: The address of the company.

Functions:
- compute_bill(): Computes the bill based on user input for items purchased.
- generate_bill(): Generates a bill receipt for the customer's purchase and updates the collection record.
- main(): Acts as the entry point, allowing users to choose between generating a bill or retrieving the total collection.

The prices provided here are for reference only

This is a simple python script which deals with functions,file handlings,exception handling,etc and i had made it as simple in the way i could.
The code can be modified to a great extend...feel free to do the same.

Lets have a challenge..
get_total_collection() function is defined here..but there is a small mistake in the logic.
Try to check it

Hint:- The function gives the total collection report of the items entered to the file.Not possible to get for a specific day
